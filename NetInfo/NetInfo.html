<h1 id="glow-network-information">GLOW Network Information</h1>
<p>This page describes GLOW network information for WLCG use.</p>
<p>LAST UPDATE: 29-Aug-2023 18:20PM CST</p>
<h2 id="network-overview">Network Overview</h2>
<p>The Wisconsin CMS Tier-2, aka Grid Laboratories of Wisconsin (GLOW) is housed in a data center in the physics department in Madison Wisconsin, which is connected by 2x100 Gbps links to the campus research backbone which is a 4x100 Gbps fabric. The backbone provides access to opportunistic computing resources in the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC), which is housed in Computer Sciences and the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery. The campus research backbone is connected to wide area research networks including LHCONE and Internet2 in Chicago via two independent routes each of which is composed of 2x100G links.</p>
<h3 id="network-description">Network Description</h3>
<p>Computers from prior to 2017 have 1 Gbps links to our LAN. All newer ones have 10 Gbps links. The 10G endpoints are connected to Nexus 93108TC-EX rack switches. These rack switches each have 100G links to a pair of Nexus 9336C-FX2 building switches that together are connected at 2x100G to the campus research network backbone, which operates on 4x100G links between Juniper MX10003 core routers. The UW-Madison research backbone is connected to wide area research networks in Chicago via two independent routes each of which is composed of 2x100G links. In Chicago, the connections are to national research networks including Internet2 and ESNet. Via ESNet, our CMS Tier-2 is connected to the LHCONE international network.</p>
<h3 id="peering-description">Peering Description</h3>
<p>Please describe how your site connects by responding to the following questions:</p>
<p><strong>How does your site connect for commodity (non research and education) connectivity (www.google.com, www.github.com, etc)?</strong> TODO</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>If so, who do you peer with and what is the bandwidth available for this type of traffic?</strong> TODO</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are there any firewall or security devices in-line with this traffic? If so, please describe.</strong> There is no firewall device in the path to/from the UW CMS Tier-2 and commodity networks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are connected to LHCONE, who/where do you peer with and at what bandwidth?</strong> The UW CMS Tier-2 connects to LHCONE via ESnet in Chicago at 2x100Gpbs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are there any firewall or security devices in-line with this traffic? If so, please describe.</strong> No firewalls or security devices for LHCONE.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are connected to LHCOPN, how to you connect and peer with CERN and at what bandwidth?</strong> UW CMS Tier-2 has no LHCOPN connection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are there any firewall or security devices in-line with this traffic? If so, please describe.</strong> Not applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do you have a peering for research and education networks for non-LHCONE sites?</strong> Yes, those are ESnet, Internet2, and WRIPS.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>If so, who/where do you peer with and at what bandwidth?</strong> Two 2x100 Gbps links in Chicago.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are there any firewall or security devices in-line with this traffic? If so, please describe.</strong> No firewalls or security devices.</p></li>
</ul>
